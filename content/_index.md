## About me

<img src="/images/headshot.JPG" alt="Jaelyn Bos headshot" width="150" style="float:left; margin-right:20px; border-radius:50%;">

Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I work under the auspices of the [Global Change Research Group](https://globalchange.sites.ucsc.edu/) at UCSC, and collaborate significantly with the Universidade Lúrio [Faculdade de Ciências Naturais](https://www.unilurio.ac.mz/unilurio/pt/ensino/faculdades/faculdade-de-ciencias-naturais) in Pemba, Mozambique. 
	
My current research focuses on seascape genetics and local adaptation in branching corals (*Acropora*). I use a variety of tools including field sampling, bioinformatics, and remote sensing to study how and at what spatial scales corals adapt to varying ocean conditions, including high temperatures. 

I'm interested in future opportunities involving a variety of marine taxa, especially relating to questions of conservation genetics, evolution, and adaptation to global change. I value science that supports human  wellbeing in vulnerable areas.
